 The dam was constructed by King Karikala Chola of the Chola Dynasty in between the 100 BC- 100 century AD. 
The dam is located on the River Kaveri, approximately 20km from the city of Tiruchirapalli.
The purpose of the dam was to divert the waters of the Kaveri across the fertile Thanjavur delta region for irrigation by canals.
The dam provides water for irrigating 400,000ha of land along the Delta Region. 
The structure measures 329m in length, 20m in width and 5.4m in height.
Improvements were made to the dam in the 19th century by Arthur Cottons, a British general and irrigation engineer.
It is the fourth oldest water diversion or water-regulator structures in the world and the oldest in India which is still in use
